# Just Kirito Cyan 
A different look of  GGO kirito if anyone wants a new look to their discord.

## Installing
> Note: Installing will assume that you have Betterdiscord and the GGO Kirito theme installed

Installing is very simple. All you need to do is to copy and paste into the file. 
<br> You may get rid of the old `:root` or you can comment it out by doing `/*` in front of the `:root` and `*/` to the end. By doing this, CSS will ignore the code, otherwise it will apply the bottom `:root` in the file

If there is any issues, state them in the 'Issues' tab.
